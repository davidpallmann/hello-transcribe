# Hello, Transcribe!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Transcribe!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-transcribe) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Transcribe and Speech-to-Text. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Transcribe and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to perform Speech-to-Text. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Transcribe Project

We will first get familiar with Amazon Transcribe in the AWS console, then we'll write a .NET program that transcribes audio and video files. We'll do that by uploading audio/video to S3, starting a batch Transcribe job, waiting for it to finish, and retrieving the transcript output from S3.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
